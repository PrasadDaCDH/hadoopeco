/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf


To take a backup of the single database :
pg_dump tecmintdb > tecmintdb.sql

To bakup all databases at once:
pg_dumpall > all_09092022.sql

To restore it all:
pgsql -f all_pg_dbs.sql postgres


For Auto backup Script creation through crontab:

You can perform backups at regular intervals using cron jobs. Cron jobs are a commonly used means for scheduling various kinds of tasks to run on a server.

You can configure a cron job to automate PostgreSQL database backup as follows. Note that you need to run the following commands as the PostgreSQL superuser:

$ mkdir -p /srv/backups/databases
Next, run the following command to edit the crontab to add a new cron job.

$ crontab -e
Copy and paste the following line at the end of the crontab. You can use any of the dump formats explained above.

0 0 * * *  pg_dump  -U postgres tecmintdb > /srv/backups/postgres/tecmintdb.sql
Save the file and exit.
