Following are the Steps taken to resolve the issue.

Issue:
one namenode was not able to stay active 
it was always going to stop when it becomes active namenode.

Root cause of the issue:
Linux team has done patching on one machine and when machine was restarted
it has firewall enabled wchich made one journal node incosistend beacause of which
the namenode gone into inconsistent state.

Following is the solution:

1>Will put HDFS in safe mode :
hdfs dfsadmin -fs hdfs://ganga.localdomain:8020 -safemode enter
2>Will save the namespace:
hdfs dfsadmin -fs hdfs://ganga.localdomain:8020 -saveNamespace
3>Stop all Both HDFS Namenodes services and JournalNode Services
>>Make Sure to Move the current data from krishna(bad) JN directory to alternate location first

#su root
#cd /hadoop/hdfs/journal/devcluster/current 
#mv * /opt/backupjournal/
4>Copy the original journalnode data from good JN to Krishna(bad) JN servers same directory
>>scp from ganga (which one is active namenode)
>>Become a root user
#scp -r /hadoop/hdfs/journal/devcluster/current/* root@krishna.localdomain:/hadoop/hdfs/journal/devcluster/current/
>>Make sure you set the permission and ownership properly
#chown hdfs:hadoop /hadoop/hdfs/journal/devcluster/current/*

7>Start the JournalNode krishna,godavari,ganga one by one node on Ambari:
8> Start the active NameNode to refresh the configuration and then stop it.
9> On the previous active node, run
hdfs namenode -initializeSharedEdits -force
hdfs zkfc -formatZK -force
11>Restart the active NameNode
12>On the standby NameNode run takes the current image from active namenode
hdfs namenode -bootstrapStandby
13>Start the Standby namenode
14>After it starts as a standby then restart the zkfc to make one into active
Thats it keep Monitoring
